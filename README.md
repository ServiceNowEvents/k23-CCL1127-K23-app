===============================================
This is the bare bones branch_0 scaffolding for the Knowledge 23 UI Component lab

# Branches
The branches are setup with **main** containing the completed lab and branches for each exercise that represents the state of that exercise *at completion*.  This can be used to catch you up.  E.g., if you are unable to complete exercise 1 you may use a GIT command like the following to retrieve the completed exercise to begin dev on Exercise 2.  
```
git checkout exercise_1
```

## Branches
| Branch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| main | Completed app |
| exercise_0 | Installing CLI and Scaffolding (start here) |
| exercise_1 | Authentication and Camera Initialization |
| exercise_2 | Properties and Test Page |
| exercise_3 | Triggering and Handling Events |
| exercise_4 | Deploying to an instance |

Use the following command to switch branches.  Start with exercise_0.
```
git checkout exercise_0
```
